## 1. Set Clear Goals

Before diving into any training program, it's crucial to establish clear, measurable goals. Whether you want to:
- Improve overall fitness
- Build muscle
- Lose weight
- Train for a specific event

Having clear goals will help you stay motivated and track your progress effectively.

## 2. Start Gradually

One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is doing too much too soon. Start with:
- 2-3 training sessions per week
- 30-45 minutes per session
- Focus on proper form over intensity
- Include rest days between workouts

## 3. Basic Equipment

You don't need a fully equipped gym to start. Begin with:
- Comfortable training clothes
- Good quality running shoes
- Water bottle
- Exercise mat

## 4. Track Your Progress

Use our app to:
- Log your workouts
- Monitor your progress
- Adjust your training plan

Remember, consistency is key. Start small, stay consistent, and gradually increase the intensity of your workouts as you build strength and endurance.

Happy training!
